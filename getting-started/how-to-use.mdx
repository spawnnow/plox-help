## 1. Create an Account

- Login or Sign-up to save your details, documents and subscription plan
- Depending on your needs, you choose from the Free, Plus and Pro Plans

## **2. Upload Your Document**

- Once logged in, go to the **Documents** tab.
- Click **‚ÄúUpload Document‚Äù**
- Drag and drop your file or click to browse from your device
- Plus and Pro users can upload larger files (up to 3GB)

üìå _Tip: Give your file a descriptive name to keep things organized._

## 3. **Set Access Controls**

Before sharing, choose who can access your document:

### **Anyone with the link** (default)

This option allows anyone with the share link to open and view your document‚Äîno login or verification required. It‚Äôs perfect for low-risk, public sharing where convenience matters more than security.

### Allow specific email addresses

Only viewers whose email addresses you‚Äôve added will be allowed to open the document. It‚Äôs a great choice for investor decks, client work, or confidential files meant for a small group.

### Add a Password

Require viewers to enter a password before they can view your document. This is a quick way to add an extra layer of protection, especially when you‚Äôre sharing links widely but still want control.

### Disable downloads

Prevent others from downloading your document‚Äîensuring your content stays view-only. This is helpful when sharing sensitive materials or early-stage documents that shouldn't be distributed offline.

### Email to view

Ask viewers to enter their email before accessing the document. This allows you to track who is viewing your file‚Äîeven if you're not restricting access to specific addresses.

### Email verification

Viewers must enter their email and verify it using a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their inbox. This ensures only the rightful recipient can open the document‚Äîeven if the link is forwarded. It adds a serious layer of security and peace of mind.

## 4. **Share Your Document**

Once your document is ready

- Copy the secure link
- Share the link via email, chat, or any method you prefer

üìå _Pro plan users can use a custom domain for links (e.g., docs.yourcompany.com)._

## 5. **Track Viewer Analytics**

After sharing, Plox gives you detailed insights:

- Who viewed your document
- When they viewed it
- How long they spent on each page
- What device they used

üìä _Pro users can export analytics data as CSV for reporting._

## 6. **Organize Using Data Rooms**

Want to group multiple documents together?

- Go to the **Data Rooms** section
- Click **‚ÄúCreate Data Room‚Äù**
- Add documents and invite viewers

üìÅ Great for fundraising, M&A, onboarding, and investor updates.

Upgrade to Plus or Pro to unlock:

- **Custom branding** (your logo, colors)

- **White-label experience** (Pro plan)
- **Slack integration** for team workflows

# FAQs

- Will I be notified when someone accesses a document via OTP?

  Yes. Plox sends real-time analytics and notifications (if enabled) when someone successfully verifies via OTP and views your document.
- What does ‚Äúdisable downloads‚Äù do?

  It prevents viewers from downloading your document. They can view it online but can‚Äôt save a copy‚Äîideal for confidential or read-only content.
- Is OTP email verification available on all plans?

  No, it‚Äôs available only in the Plus and Pro plans, as it requires additional security layers and email validation systems.
- Can I resend the same document with different access settings?

  Absolutely. You can create a new share link with its own settings while keeping the original document in place.
- Can I remove access to a document after it's been shared?

  Yes, you can revoke access instantly by disabling the link or changing access settings.
- What happens if someone forwards my document link?

  If you‚Äôve enabled email restrictions, password protection, or OTP verification, unauthorized users won‚Äôt be able to open the file‚Äîeven if they have the link.
