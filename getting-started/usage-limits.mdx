# **Upload Limits**

## [**What Is an Upload Limit?**](https://www.plox.in/help/upload-limits#what-is-an-upload-limit)

An upload limit is the maximum size or number of files you can upload and store on your Plox account based on your current plan.

It determines:

- How large each individual file can be (e.g. 250MB, 1GB, 3GB)
- How many documents you can upload in total
- How much total storage space you’re allowed to use across all files
- Whether you can organize files in nested folders
- Whether you can bulk upload multiple files at once

## [**How It Works**](https://www.plox.in/help/upload-limits#how-it-works)

- When you [upload a document](https://www.plox.in/help/uploading-a-document), Plox checks:
  - If the file size is within your plan’s per-file limit
  - If the total number of uploaded files is still within your plan’s cap
  - If you’re within your total storage quota
- If any limit is exceeded:
  - You’ll receive a prompt explaining which limit was hit (file size, storage, or document count)
  - You’ll be asked to either upgrade your plan or manage existing files to make space
- Folder support and bulk upload features are also plan-specific. They’re automatically available or restricted depending on the plan you're subscribed to.
