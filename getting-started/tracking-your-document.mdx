## Where to Find Document Analytics

- After uploading your document, you will a side bar on the left-hand side
- Click on the option labelled as “Analytics”
- After clicking on “Analytics”, you will be able to see a dashboard with the features explained below
- These features allows you to accurately track your document from different aspects

## Identity

Viewer identity is captured through email-based access or OTP verification. Instead of anonymous clicks, you’ll know exactly who opened your document, giving you confidence in your outreach and follow-ups.

- This option is the first that appears on the dashboard row section
- If you enable email verification or email-restricted access, Plox tracks exactly who opened your document.
- This feature displays the full name of the viewer. This enables you to understand if the document was opened/viewed by someone and by who
- Using this, you can confirm if the right person(e.g., investor, client) has engaged with the document
- Avoid guessing or relying on “I’ll get back to you” emails, simply check if the document viewed or not using Identity

## Time

Each document view is timestamped with precise date and time data, so you know exactly when your file was accessed. This gives you valuable signals about interest and intent.

- Just next to Identity is the 'Time' section, which shows when the document was opened.
- Each view is timestamped with date and time, so you know exactly when someone accessed your file.
- This is the perfect feature for timely follow-ups after sharing a pitch or proposal
- It also helps you understand if someone is revisiting older documents.
- Example: If you sent a business proposal to an investor weeks ago and they recently revisited the document, it could indicate renewed interest, giving you the perfect opportunity to follow up or send an updated version.

## Location

Plox tracks the approximate geographic location of each document viewer based on their IP address. This typically includes city and country-level data, and gives you a better sense of where your content is being accessed from.

Knowing the location of your viewers helps you:

- Understand the regional distribution of your audience or leads
- Spot access from unexpected locations, which could indicate internal sharing or potential misuse
- Align your follow-ups with time zones or local business hours
- Identify international interest for expansion or investor outreach
- Example: You shared a pitch deck with a VC based in Toronto. A week later, the document is viewed multiple times from San Francisco. That could suggest it’s been forwarded to their U.S. partners—an early sign that your pitch is getting traction across geographies

## Platform

When someone views your document, the system captures both the type of device—like desktop, mobile, or tablet—and the operating system, such as Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.

Understanding the platform can help you:

- Optimize your documents for the devices your audience uses most
- Ensure mobile readability for smartphone viewers
- Spot unusual access patterns that may suggest internal forwarding or external sharing
- Tailor follow-ups (e.g., referencing "on-the-go" access if they’re viewing from a phone)
- Example: You notice a decision-maker consistently opens your pitch deck from an **iPhone**, while their colleague views it on **Windows desktop**. That tells you one is likely skimming on the move, and the other is reviewing in detail—so you can tailor your messaging accordingly.

## Time Spent

Engagement time is recorded at both the document and per-page level, helping you see whether viewers are skimming or reading deeply. Longer views often signal interest or consideration—use that insight to tailor your follow-up with precision.

- You’ll see how long each viewer spent on your document, both overall and per page.
- Know if they skimmed or read deeply
- Use it as a signal for interest (e.g., longer view = higher engagement)
- Useful for qualifying leads or tailoring follow-up messages
- Example: You see someone spent 2 minutes on Page 1 but only 3 seconds on your pricing page. That’s a signal to simplify or clarify your pricing section before the next share.

## Completion

Plox tracks whether viewers scroll through the entire document or leave midway. Completion rate gives you a clear signal of engagement and interest level.

If people consistently drop off before the end, you might need to tighten the content or move important details earlier in the document.

- Track whether a viewer completed the document or dropped off midway.
- Identify weak points or bottlenecks in your presentation or pitch deck
- Learn which pages people tend to abandon on
- Understand how engaged viewers are with your entire message
- Example: A key prospect exits halfway through your deck. You decide to move your CTA and traction metrics closer to the front—and next time, they finish it.
