# Understanding document analytics

Plox gives you powerful analytics to help you understand how people interact with your documents and data rooms. These metrics help you make smarter decisions—whether you're tracking investor interest, internal engagement, or client feedback.

This guide breaks down each metric, what it means, and how to use it effectively.

## Viewer-Specific Metrics (Tracking Data)

These appear in the row of the data room or file selected by the user for analysis

### Identity (Email)

**What it is:**

The email address of the person who viewed your file.

**When it's available:**

Only if you enabled **“Require Email”** or **“Email Verification via OTP.”**

**Why it matters:**

Tells you exactly who is engaging with your document. Great for follow-ups and lead qualification.

**Use it for:**

- Prioritizing interested leads
- Sending personalized follow-ups
- Verifying if stakeholders actually viewed your pitch

### Time of Access

**What it is:**

The exact date and time the viewer opened your document.

**Why it matters:**

Helps you see when interest peaks. If someone reopens your doc days later, that’s a signal of renewed interest.

**Use it for:**

- Timely follow-ups
- Tracking return visits
- Identifying key engagement windows

### Location

**What it is:**

City and country (IP-based) where the file was accessed.

**Why it matters:**

Gives insight into geographic reach. You’ll know if your doc was shared across regions or accessed in unexpected places.

**Use it for:**

- Spotting international interest
- Preventing unauthorized sharing
- Tailoring outreach based on region

### Platform

**What it is:**

The OS/device used—e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, Android.

**Why it matters:**

Helps you understand how people are consuming your content (e.g., skimming on mobile vs. reading on desktop).

**Use it for:**

- Optimizing layout for mobile
- Spotting usage patterns
- Improving viewer experience

### Time Spent

**What it is:**

How long the viewer spent reading your document.

**Why it matters:**

Signals interest. A short view might mean they bounced, while a longer one could suggest serious consideration.

**Use it for:**

- Prioritizing leads
- Identifying strong vs. weak sections
- Improving content based on engagement

### Completion Rate

**What it is:**

The percentage of the document that was viewed by a person.

**Why it matters:**

Tells you if they actually finished reading or dropped off midway.

**Use it for:**

- Improving structure of your doc
- Placing important content earlier
- Identifying sections that lose attention

## Aggregate Metrics

**What it is:**

Total unique viewers since the data room was created.

**Why it matters:**

- Spotting periods of inactivity or spikes
- Reporting performance to stakeholders

Comparing room performance

Improving low-performing documents

Identifying valuable content types

### Average Completion Rate

**What it is:**

## FAQs

- Where do these analytics metrics appear?

  You’ll see them in the Analytics tab, either at the data room level or when drilling into a specific file or folder. Viewer-specific metrics appear in the row of the file or data room you've chosen to analyze.
- What’s the difference between data room analytics and file-level analytics?

  Data room analytics are averaged metrics across all documents (like overall time spent or completion). File-level analytics give you detailed insights per document and per viewer.
- What does "Completion Rate" actually mean?

  It’s the percentage of the document viewed by a specific user (or the average across all users, if at the data room level). A low percentage may indicate they dropped off early.
- How do I analyze a file that’s inside a folder?

  Use the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the Analytics tab. You can choose the specific data room → folder → file to view targeted metrics.
- Does Plox track the viewer’s device or operating system?

  Yes! The Platform metric shows whether a document was opened on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc.—and whether it was accessed via desktop, mobile, or tablet.
- Can I export these metrics?

  Yes, if you’re on the Pro plan, you can export viewer/session data as a CSV.
