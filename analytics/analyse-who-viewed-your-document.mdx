# Analyse who viewed your document

## How to See Who Viewed Your Document

- Go to the **Documents** or **Data Rooms** section of your dashboard
- Click the **"View Analytics"** icon next to the document or data room
- Scroll through the viewer list to see **who accessed your file**, along with detailed engagement metrics

## What Viewer Information Is Tracked

If access controls are enabled, Plox captures:

- **Viewer‚Äôs Email Address** (when ‚ÄúRequire Email‚Äù or OTP is turned on)
- **Time of Access**
- **Platform / Device Used** (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, etc.)
- **Location** (City & Country ‚Äì IP-based)
- **Time Spent on the Document**
- **Completion Percentage** (How much of the document they actually viewed)

## Enable Viewer Identification

To analyze exactly **who** is viewing your document, turn on any of these access controls from the **three-dot menu ‚Üí Access Controls**:

- **Require Email to View** ‚Äì viewer must enter an email before viewing
- **Email Verification via OTP** ‚Äì confirms the viewer owns the email they entered
- **Restrict Access by Email** ‚Äì only selected users can view the file

üìå Without these enabled, analytics will show **anonymous viewer activity** only.

## Where This Applies

- Individual documents
- Files inside data rooms
- Files organized within folders
- Bulk-tracked views across teams or leads

## Why This Matters

- **Qualify leads** based on viewing behavior
- **Time your follow-ups** when someone reopens a document
- **Track interest** in different parts of your pitch or proposal
- **Spot unverified access** or unusual locations instantly

## FAQs
