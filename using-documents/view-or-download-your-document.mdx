# View or download your document?

## How to View a Document

When someone receives your shared link and opens it:

- The document will open directly in the browser, no downloads required
- Viewers can scroll through the file securely, with no installation or sign-up needed
- The viewing experience includes your branding (Plus/Pro plans) and optional access restrictions

## How to Download a Document

By default, Plox allows viewers to download the document **only if download is enabled** in your access settings.

1. Click on the document link shared to you
2. On the document viewing platform, there will an option/icon to download
3. Click on the download option/icon and the document will start getting downloaded
4. The downloaded document will be present in your device storage

## Why Disable Downloads?

If you're sharing sensitive or proprietary information, you may want to **disable downloads** so the file can't be saved offline or reshared. This is useful for:

- Investor decks
- Legal or HR documents
- Time-sensitive proposals
- Internal or confidential files

## Viewer-Side Checklist: What They Experience

Here’s what your viewers will see when accessing your document:

### If Downloads Are Enabled:

- Document opens in their browser
- A download icon or link is available
- They can save the file to their device
- Your branding (logo + company name) is visible (on Plus & Pro plans)

### If Downloads Are Disabled:

- Document opens in their browser
- No download option is shown
- They can scroll and read the entire file online
- Your branding is still visible (on Plus & Pro plans)

## FAQs

- Can I view a document without downloading it?

  Yes! All shared documents open in-browser by default, allowing seamless viewing without downloading.
- How do I prevent someone from downloading my document?

  Turn off the “Allow Download” toggle in Access Controls. This makes the file view-only.
- If I disable downloads, can viewers still see the whole document?

  Yes. Disabling downloads only blocks file saving. Viewers can still read the document online in full.
- Can I allow some people to download and others not to?

  For segmented access, duplicate the document and set different rules like only specific emails can access document 1 and download it, while the duplicate document 1 can only be viewed by whoever has the link but not download it.
- Will I be notified when someone views or downloads my document?

  If you're on the Plus or Pro plan and have alerts enabled, yes—Plox will notify you when your document is viewed. Download notifications are coming soon.
- Do documents look different when viewed vs. downloaded?

  No. The file is exactly the same—what you see in the browser is what you’d get in a download (if allowed).
