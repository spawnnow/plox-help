# Sharing a document

## How to Share a Document

- Go to the **Documents** section in your dashboard
- Find the document you want to share
- Click the **“Copy Link”** icon on the document row
- Paste and send this link to anyone—via email, chat, calendar invite, or any platform you prefer

## Customize Access Before You Share

Before copying the link, you can configure how recipients will be able to view it:

- **Anyone with the link** – No restrictions, ideal for public or low-sensitivity documents.
- **Restrict to email addresses** – Only specified emails can open the link.
- **Add a password** – Protects your document with an extra layer of security.
- **OTP Verification** – Sends a one-time code to the recipient’s email to prove ownership.
- **Set expiration date** – Automatically disables the link after a specific date.
- **Disable downloads** – Prevents viewers from saving the file offline.
- **Limit number of views** – Allow the document to be opened only a set number of times.

All of these settings are available in the document’s access control options.

## FAQS

- Can I update access settings after sharing the link?

  Yes! You can change access controls at any time—even after the link has been sent.
- Will viewers be able to download my document?

  Only if you allow it. You can disable downloads in the access controls to keep the file view-only.
- Can I preview what the link looks like before sharing?

  Yes. Just click the preview icon next to the document. You’ll see exactly what the recipient sees.
- Can I reuse the same share link for multiple people?

  Yes. You can share the same link with multiple recipients. Just make sure your access settings (like email restrictions or OTP) are configured to match your intent.
- Can I change the link URL after it's created?

  Not manually. However, if you're on the Plus or Pro plan, your custom domain will be used to personalize the link (e.g., [docs.yourbrand.com/](http://docs.yourbrand.com/)...).
