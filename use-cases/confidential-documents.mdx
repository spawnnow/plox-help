# Confidential Documents

## What Are Confidential Documents?

Confidential documents include anything you don’t want shared, downloaded, or seen by unauthorized users. These may be internal, legal, financial, or strategic in nature, and require **strict access control**, **visibility tracking**, and **data security**.

## Common Confidential Documents Shared via Plox

- Legal agreements (NDAs, contracts, acquisition docs)
- Term sheets & cap tables
- Financial statements & audits
- Internal memos and board decks
- HR files (offer letters, performance reviews)
- Fundraising materials with sensitive projections
- Compliance or security reports
- Private client deliverables

## Key Plox Features for Confidential Sharing

### 1. **Restrict Access to Authorized Viewers**

- **Require Email to View** – capture viewer identity
- **OTP Verification** – verify identity with one-time passwords
- **Restrict by Email** – only pre-approved emails can access
- **Password Protection** – add custom passwords for legal or HR docs
- **Disable Downloads** – prevent files from being saved or redistributed

Plox gives you multiple layers of security—use one or combine many.

### 2. **Track Every Interaction**

- See when the file was opened
- Know who viewed it
- Track time spent reading
- Monitor completion rate
- Get alerted on repeat views
- View location and device metadata

This provides a full audit trail for regulatory, legal, or internal compliance purposes.

### 3. **Revoke or Update Access at Any Time**

- Remove access manually with a click
- Update files in real-time (no need to resend links)
- Set auto-expiration for temporary access (e.g. 7 days, 1 month)

Perfect for time-sensitive or high-risk document sharing.

### 4. **Brand the Viewer to Build Trust**

- Add your **company’s logo and name**
- Use a **custom domain** like `secure.yourcompany.com`
- Remove Plox branding entirely with the **Pro plan**

Recipients instantly know the file is authentic and professional—not a sketchy or spoofed link.
