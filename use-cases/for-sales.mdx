# For Sales

Whether you're a solo founder doing outbound or part of a full sales team, Plox gives you the tools to send **secure, branded, and trackable** documents that show you exactly who's engaging.

## Documents Sales Reps Commonly Share

- Pitch decks and company overviews
- Product brochures and one-pagers
- Pricing sheets and proposal PDFs
- Case studies and whitepapers
- Contracts or agreements
- Personalized follow-up documents

## Key Plox Features for Sales

### 1. **Branded, Shareable Documents**

Use your own **logo, company name**, and even a **custom domain** to make each doc look polished and professional—no more sketchy-looking file links.

Example: `https://files.yourcompany.com/demo-pricing`

### 2. **Track Engagement in Real Time**

Know exactly how prospects interact with your documents:

- Who opened it
- When they viewed it
- Time spent reading
- Device and location
- Completion rate (% of doc viewed)

This turns every share into **sales intelligence**.

### 3. **Access Controls = Sales Confidence**

Control how your documents are accessed:

- Require email to collect contact info
- Use OTP verification for qualified leads only
- Disable downloads to keep documents internal
- Expire links after a few days or a specific call

No more guessing who clicked. No more “I never got it.”

### 4. **Data Rooms for Complex Deals**

Need to send multiple documents (case studies, pricing, proposal, contract) to a single lead?

Create a **Sales Data Room** and send one clean link. Track everything inside.

## Why Sales Teams Love Plox

- Look **professional** with every share
- Use **viewing data** to time follow-ups perfectly
- Send **one link** instead of 5 attachments
- Avoid **leaks or untracked forwards**
- Build **trust** through branded, secure delivery

## FAQs

- What kind of sales content can I share with Plox?

  Anything from pitch decks and brochures to pricing PDFs and contracts. Plox handles all common document formats securely.
- How do I know if a lead opened my file?

  Plox tracks every view and shows details like email (if enabled), time of access, time spent, and completion percentage.
