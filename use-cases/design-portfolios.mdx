# Design Portfolios

## Why Designers Use Plox

Designers spend hours (or weeks) crafting stunning portfolios, yet when it's time to share, most are forced to use tools like Drive or Behance—where files can be copied, downloaded, or forwarded without their knowledge.

**Plox gives designers full control, privacy, and insights** into how their portfolio is being received, so they can impress clients _and_ protect their work.

## What You Can Share as Design Portfolios

- Case studies
- Dribbble-style UI shots
- PDF portfolios
- Motion design reels
- Web design walkthroughs
- Brand identity decks
- Visual resumes

Whether it's for a freelance pitch, agency application, or client showcase, Plox lets you package it all into one secure, professional experience.

## How Plox Helps Designers Share Portfolios Securely

### 1. **Control Who Can View Your Work**

- **Require Email to View** – identify who’s accessing your portfolio
- **Email Verification via OTP** – ensure only real prospects are viewing it
- **Restrict by Email** – share with specific clients, companies, or hiring managers
- **Disable Downloads** – keep your files from being copied or reused
- **Password Protection** – add an optional layer for VIP or NDA-restricted work

### 2. **Track Portfolio Engagement Like a Pro**

- See **which pieces got the most views**
- Track **how much time** people spent on each section
- Monitor **completion rates** (did they scroll to the end?)
- Get insights on **repeat viewers** (potential hot leads)
- Check **location and platform** – are they viewing on desktop? iPad?
- Know **when** your portfolio was viewed — perfect for follow-up timing

This helps you focus on which designs get attention, what to feature more, and who to follow up with.

### 3. **Deliver a Branded, Professional Experience**

- Add your **name or studio branding**
- Use a **custom domain** like `portfolio.annadesigns.com` (Pro plan)
- Remove Plox branding for a seamless, white-labeled viewer (Pro plan only)

It’s the portfolio equivalent of showing up with a sharp suit and a confident smile.

### 4. **Organize by Style or Client**

Create **folders** inside a data room to organize your work:

- Web Design
- Branding
- Motion Graphics
- Case Studies

  You can even create separate data rooms for each client or role you’re applying for.

## Why Designers Love Plox

- Present work _securely_ and _professionally_
- Know _who_ viewed what, _when_, and for _how long_
- Send portfolios without fear of copying or misuse
- Tailor access to _specific clients or companies_
- Analyze what designs attract the most interest

## FAQs

- Can I share my portfolio without letting people download it?

  Yes! Just toggle off “Allow Download” in the access controls. Viewers can see it, but not save or copy.
- How do I know who viewed my portfolio?

  Enable “Require Email” or “OTP Verification.” You’ll see exactly who viewed your work in the analytics dashboard.
- Can I see which designs people liked most?

  You can see which files were viewed most, how long people spent, and which ones they completed—great for identifying popular pieces.
- What if someone forwards my portfolio link?

  If you restrict by email or use OTP, the forwarded link won’t work for others. Only verified users can access it.
- Can I get notified when someone views my portfolio?

  Yes! On Plus and Pro plans, you can enable real-time email alerts.
- Can I use a custom domain for my portfolio?

  Yes, with the Pro plan, you can share from [portfolio.yourname.com](http://portfolio.yourname.com/) or any custom domain.
- Do I need to re-upload everything for each client?

  Not at all. You can duplicate folders or create new data rooms using existing content—fast and efficient.
