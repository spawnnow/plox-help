# For Fundraising

Raising capital is one of the most critical (and stressful) moments for any startup. Plox helps founders share fundraising materials with investors in a way that’s **secure, professional, trackable**, and built for modern investor expectations.

Whether you're sending your pitch deck to 10 angels or running a full-blown Series A, Plox helps you stay in control of your documents—and your narrative.

## Documents Commonly Shared During Fundraising

Fundraising often involves sharing a mix of sensitive and strategic files. Plox helps organize and secure all of these in one place:

- Pitch Decks
- Financial Models
- Cap Tables
- Market Research & Go-To-Market Plans
- Investor Updates
- Competitive Analyses
- Term Sheets & Legal Documents
- Traction Metrics, Screenshots, or User Dashboards

Instead of sending scattered files via email or messy Google Drive folders, you can create a single branded data room and share it with confidence.

## Organize Everything with a Fundraising Data Room

With Plox, you can build a **fundraising-focused data room** in minutes:

- Upload all relevant documents in one place
- Use **folders** to separate pitch materials, financials, and legal docs
- Easily add/remove documents or replace outdated ones
- Share a **single clean link** with investors or accelerators

Example: `https://invest.yourstartup.com/data-room`

No more lost links. No more clunky Drive permissions. Just professional, one-click access.

## Keep Control with Advanced Access Settings

Fundraising documents often include confidential projections or sensitive ownership information. Plox gives you complete control over access:

- **Require Email to View** – Collect investor identities
- **Email Verification via OTP** – Ensure only valid recipients open your materials
- **Disable Downloads** – Let them read but not save or share
- **Restrict by Email** – Only give access to selected VC or angel email addresses
- **Set Expiry Dates** – Automatically disable access after a meeting or deadline
- **Alerts** – Get notified when someone opens your deck or verifies their identity

All of this works quietly in the background—so you’re always in control, without friction.

## Know Who's Actually Interested

Every founder sends out decks. Few know who actually opens them.

Plox provides real-time analytics on each document shared:

- **Who viewed it** (email)
- **When they viewed it**
- **Time spent reading**
- **Completion rate** – Did they finish the deck?
- **Device & location** – Are they viewing it on mobile, desktop, abroad?

These insights help you follow up with the right investors, at the right time—with full context.

## Build Trust with Branding

Investors receive dozens of decks a week. Branded materials make you stand out:

- Add your **startup’s logo and name** to every shared document
- Show your **custom domain** (like `invest.yourstartup.com`)
- Remove Plox branding entirely (Pro plan) for a clean, white-label experience

It’s the difference between a generic link and a polished brand experience that says, “We’re ready.”

- **Share securely with full access control**
