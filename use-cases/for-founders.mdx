# For Founders

## Why Founders Use Plox

As a founder, you're constantly sending documents to investors‚Äîpitch decks, traction updates, board notes, and more. But traditional tools like email or Google Drive don‚Äôt tell you if your documents were opened, who viewed them, or if your message landed.

Plox fixes that with an all-in-one solution to **share documents professionally, track engagement, and stay in control.**

## How Startup Founders Use Plox

### 1. **Organize Everything in a Data Room**

Create an **Investor Data Room** to house all your fundraising materials:

- üìÅ Decks, cap tables, legal docs, metrics ‚Äî organized by folder
- üîó Share a single link with investors
- üîÑ Update documents without changing the link
- üîç Track engagement on every file inside the data room

> Example: https://invest.yourstartup.com/series-a

### 2. **Control Who Can Access**

Plox helps you protect sensitive documents with flexible access controls:

- **Require Email to View**: Know exactly who‚Äôs reading your material
- **OTP Verification**: Ensure that only the intended recipient gets access
- **Restrict by Email**: Limit file access to specific investors
- **Password Protection**: Add a custom password for added security
- **Disable Downloads**: Prevent offline sharing or unauthorized storage
- **Set Expiry Dates**: Automatically revoke access after a round closes

### 3. Track Engagement With Analytics

Plox turns every document into a source of insight:

- When was it opened?
- Who opened it? (name/email)
- How long did they view it?
- Did they finish reading it?
- Where were they located?
- What device/platform did they use?

Use this data to prioritize your warmest leads, follow up smartly, and close your round with confidence.

### 4. Brand Your Sharing Experience

Make a strong impression with every link:

- Upload your logo and company name
- Use a custom domain like [invest.yourstartup.com](http://invest.yourstartup.com/)
- Remove Plox branding entirely (Pro plan only) for full white-labeling

This shows professionalism and reassures investors that they‚Äôre receiving something secure and official.

### 5. **Send Real-Time Alerts to Yourself**

Get notified when:

- An investor views a document
- A document is opened after days of silence
- A new viewer accesses the data room via forward

This helps you strike while the interest is hot‚Äîno more blind follow-ups.

## Benefits for Founders

- Gain insights on investor engagement
- Control access to every document
- Save time by replacing messy email threads with a single link

## FAQs
