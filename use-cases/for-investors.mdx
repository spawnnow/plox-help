# For Investors

## Who This Is For

This guide is for VCs, angel investors, LP-facing teams, family offices, and fund managers who want to securely share documents with LPs, co-investors, auditors, or legal advisors.

## What You Can Share with Plox

- LP updates and quarterly reports

- Investment memos
- Deal terms and closing documentation

## How Investors Use Plox

### 1. **Create a Secure Data Room**

Organize all outgoing updates in one place:

- Share a single link with LPs or co-investors

### 2. **Use Access Controls to Stay Compliant**

With Plox, you get transparency without intrusion:

- Ensure recipients have the **latest version**, not a PDF from 2 months ago
