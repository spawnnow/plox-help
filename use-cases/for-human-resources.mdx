# For Human Resources

From recruitment to employee onboarding and internal communication, Plox makes it easy for HR teams to share sensitive documents securely, stay organized, and track interactions without chasing confirmations.

## Common HR Documents Shared

- Offer Letters
- Employment Contracts
- NDAs and Policy Documents
- Onboarding Kits
- Performance Review Forms
- Internal Memos or Guidelines
- Exit Documents & Acknowledgements

## Share Privately with Full Control

Plox ensures HR teams can send documents with complete privacy, security, and professionalism:

- **Require Email to View** – collect and confirm candidate or employee identities
- **OTP Verification** – ensure documents are viewed only by the intended recipient
- **Password Protection** – add another layer of security for legal and personal documents
- **Disable Downloads** – prevent files from being saved or forwarded
- **Restrict by Email** – allow access only to a specific person or company email
- **Set Expiry Dates** – limit access to time-bound materials (e.g., pre-joining forms)

## Track Acknowledgements Without Follow-Ups

Tired of asking “Did you see the offer letter?”

Plox shows you:

- **When the document was opened**
- **Who viewed it (email)**
- **Time spent on the file**
- **Completion rate** (did they read it all?)
- **Platform & location** for added context

This makes onboarding and compliance a breeze—**no more guesswork**.

## Send Branded Documents with Confidence

- Add your **company logo and name** for professionalism
- Use a **custom domain** like `hr.yourcompany.com`
- Remove Plox branding entirely (Pro plan)

This assures candidates and employees that the document is authentic and secure.

## Organize HR Docs with Folders & Data Rooms

Create an **Onboarding Data Room** for each new hire with:

- Welcome letter
- Policy handbook
- IT access instructions
- NDA
- Personal info collection forms

All in one shareable link with full tracking.
