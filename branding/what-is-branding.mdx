# What is Branding?

## Introduction

**Branding in Plox** lets you personalize your shared documents and data rooms with your **company’s name and logo**—so every recipient knows exactly who the file is from, building trust and professionalism at first glance.

It’s designed for businesses, HR teams, sales reps, agencies, and startup founders who want to present their documents with clear identity and credibility.

## Where to Find the Branding Section

Once you click **“Get Started”** and land in the dashboard, you'll see the left-side navigation with the following sections:

- Documents
- Analytics
- Data Rooms
- **Branding**
- Settings

Click on “**Branding”** to begin customizing your shared document experience.

## What Branding Includes

When enabled, your **shared document or data room** will prominently display:

- **Your company logo** (top or side of the viewer interface)
- **Your company name**
- Optional: Custom domain support (for Business plan users)

This ensures that when a viewer opens your document, they know it’s coming from a **trusted, authentic source**—you.

## Who Uses Branding and Why?

### **Businesses**

Make internal reports, proposals, and investor decks look polished and official—without using generic third-party branding.

### **Startup Founders**

Impress investors and partners by presenting pitch decks with your startup’s identity front and center.

### **HR Teams**

Send onboarding documents, NDAs, and offer letters that feel professionally branded and secure.

### **Agencies & Freelancers**

Deliver client-facing files with your own logo to maintain brand consistency and build recognition.

### **Sales & Outreach Teams**

Pitch decks, pricing sheets, and demo links feel far more trustworthy when they come with your name and logo attached.

## Why Branding Matters

- Builds **viewer confidence**—your file isn’t just "another link"
- Creates a **professional first impression**
- Helps prevent confusion or skepticism when sharing externally
- Reinforces your **brand identity** with every interaction
