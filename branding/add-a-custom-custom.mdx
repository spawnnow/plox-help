# Add a custom domain

## What Is a Custom Domain?

A custom domain lets you use your own branded URL when sharing files or data rooms from Plox. Instead of sending links that start with [plox.in](http://plox.in/), your viewers will see something like:

[docs.yourcompany.com/investor-deck](http://docs.yourcompany.com/investor-deck)

## Where to Set It Up

1. Go to your **dashboard**
2. Click on **Branding** in the left-side panel
3. Scroll down to **Custom Domain**
4. Enter the domain or subdomain you want to use (e.g. `docs.yourdomain.com`)
5. Follow the DNS setup instructions (you’ll need to add a CNAME record)
6. Once DNS is configured, click **Verify** and **Activate**

Plox will handle the rest, including provisioning an **SSL certificate** so your link stays secure.

## FAQs

- What is a custom domain in Plox?

  A custom domain lets you share Plox documents using your own branded URL (like [docs.yourcompany.com](http://docs.yourcompany.com/)) instead of [plox.in](http://plox.in/).
- Who can use the custom domain feature?

  Custom domain support is only available on the Pro plan.
- Can I use my main domain (like [yourcompany.com](http://yourcompany.com/))?

  We recommend using a subdomain like [docs.yourcompany.com](http://docs.yourcompany.com/) to avoid interfering with your main website.
- Do I need to handle SSL setup?

  No. Once your domain is verified, Plox automatically generates and installs an SSL certificate for secure HTTPS access.
- How long does it take for my domain to be verified?

  Domain verification can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on your DNS provider.
- Can I change my custom domain later?

  Yes, you can update or replace your custom domain anytime in the Branding section.
