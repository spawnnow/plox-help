# Analytics & reporting

## Where to Find Data Room Analytics

- Go to the **Data Rooms** section in your dashboard
- Find the room you want to analyze
- Click **“View Analytics”** in the row next to the data room name
- You’ll be taken to the analytics dashboard for that data room

## Key Metrics

These are **room-level analytics**, meaning they reflect the combined behavior of all viewers across all documents in the room:

- **Realtime Visitors**

  View how many users are actively viewing your data room _right now_.
- **All-time Visitors**

  Shows the total number of unique users who have accessed the data room since it was shared.
- **Average Time Spent**

  Calculates the average duration viewers spend across all documents within the room.
- **Average Completion Rate**

  Aggregates how much of the room’s files viewers are finishing—great for understanding interest and content depth

## Specific Insights

You can view analytics for:

- The **entire data room**
- A **specific document** inside the room
- A **file inside a folder** within the room

To do this:

- Use the **dropdown at the top-left** of the Analytics page
- Select the data room → folder (if applicable) → individual file
- This gives you more targeted insights while keeping access organized

  Yes, analytics can be exported as a CSV file on the Pro plan.
- Will I be notified when someone views a data room?

  Not automatically. However, viewer data is updated in real time and visible under analytics.

  Analytics = Room-wide performance metrics (averages, visitor counts)
