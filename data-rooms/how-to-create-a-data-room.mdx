# How to create a data room?

## Steps to Create a Data Room

- **Click “Get Started” on the homepage**

  You’ll be redirected to the dashboard with navigation options on the left:

  **Documents**, **Analytics**, **Data Rooms**, **Branding**, **Settings**.
- **Click on “Data Rooms” in the sidebar**
- **Enter a name for your data room(Example: Data Room 1, Project A Data room)**
- Click the **“Upload Document”** button on the upper right side
- Upload works the same way as in the **Documents** section (drag & drop or browse)
- Uploaded files will show details like **Name**, **Size**, and **Updated On**
- You can also use the **“Preview”(View data room and files)** and **“View Analytics”(analytics of data room, files, file in specific folder)** buttons for each file

## Add Folders Inside the Data Room(Optional)

- Click the **“Add Folder” icon** next to Upload Document
- Name your folder(Example: Folder 1, Project A Folder)
- Organize your documents into folders inside the data room for better structure

## Once Created, You’ll See:

A row representing your data room with:

- **Name** (data room title)
- **Files** (number of documents)
- **Updated At** (date and time last modified)
- **Copy Link icon** – share this link externally
- **Preview External Data Room** – see how it looks to viewers
- **View Analytics** – see room-wide insights
