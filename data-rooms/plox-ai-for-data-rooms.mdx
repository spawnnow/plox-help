# Plox AI For Data Rooms

## What is Plox AI

Plox’s AI-powered pitch deck scanner makes it easier for founders, investors, and dealmakers to present and analyze fundraising decks inside Data Rooms. Instead of going slide by slide, the AI automatically scans uploaded pitch decks and generates a **concise overview, smart summaries, and a live metrics dashboard**.

This feature ensures that every stakeholder quickly grasps the most important information, mission, company overview, and traction, at a glance.

## How It Works

2. The scanned data is presented in a clean format on the metrics dashboard
3. Viewers can easily understand the company metrics without spending a lot of time reading every page
4. Graphs and positive/negative percentage is also calculated and made for certain metrics
