# Track a dataroom

## How to Track a Data Room

- **Go to the Data Rooms section in your dashboard**
- Locate the room you want to track
- Click the **“View Analytics”** icon in the row of that data room

## Key Metrics

Use these metrics to accurately track your data room

- **Identity** – The viewer’s Name+email (if email or OTP verification is enabled)
- **Time of Access** – When the document was opened(date and time)
- **Location** – City and country (IP-based tracking)
- **Platform** – Device and OS (e.g., macOS, Windows, iOS, Android)
- **Time Spent** – How long the viewer engaged with the document
- **Completion Rate** – How much of the document they actually viewed

These insights apply whether the file is at the root of the data room or inside a folder.

## File-Level Tracking

1. In the analytics view, locate the **dropdown in the top-left**
2. Use the dropdown to:
   - Select a specific data room
   - Choose a file within the room
   - Even select a file inside a specific folder

This allows you to track exactly **which file**, **in which folder**, was viewed, and how.
