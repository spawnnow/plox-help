# What is a data room?

A **Data Room** in Plox is a **secure, branded space** where you can group and share multiple documents using a **single shareable link**. It’s designed for scenarios where you need to present several files together—professionally, securely, and with full control.

Think of it as a curated folder, but with access controls, viewer tracking, and branding built in.
