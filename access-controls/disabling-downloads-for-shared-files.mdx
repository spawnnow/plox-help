# Disabling downloads for shared files

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to disable downloads for a document

1. Go to your file’s dashboard.\
   Locate the file for which you want to restrict downloads. You’ll see a row of options such as Share, Analytics, Security, and Delete.
2. Open the Security settings.\
   Click the lock icon labeled “Security” next to the file name.
3. Toggle off “Allow Download”
4. Save your changes.\
   Click "Continue". The restriction will be active immediately.

Once disabled, viewers will still be able to open and read the document, but they **won’t be able to download it**.

### Why and When You Should Disable Downloads

**To Protect Confidential Content**

When you're sharing internal reports, financials, legal docs, or anything sensitive, download restrictions prevent unauthorized saving or accidental leaks.

**When:**

- Sharing board updates
- Sending investor decks
- Distributing HR/legal documents

**To Prevent Unapproved Redistribution**

If you’re sharing design work, proposals, or pitch decks, you may want people to see them, but not store or reshare them outside of context.

**When:**

- Sharing visual mockups with clients
- Sending brand material under review
- Delivering watermarked documents

**To Maintain Control Over the Viewer Experience**

Sometimes, it’s important to control how and when someone sees your content. Disabling downloads keeps your content **view-only**, allowing you to track engagement without losing control of where your document ends up.

**When:**

- Delivering time-sensitive content
- Sharing docs that might be updated soon
- Presenting something without leaving a file trail

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

When a viewer opens your shared link:

- If downloads are **enabled**, they’ll see a **download icon**
- If downloads are **disabled**, the option will be completely**inactive** 
- They can still view the document in-browser as long as they meet the other access requirements (email, password, OTP, etc.)

This ensures your content stays **on-platform only**.

## Keep in Mind

- Combine this feature with **OTP verification** or **email restrictions** for maximum control.
- You can **toggle it on/off anytime**, even after the document has been shared.

## FAQs

- Can I disable downloads for any document?

  Yes, you can disable downloads for any document you've uploaded.
- What happens if I disable downloads after I’ve shared the link?

  The change takes effect immediately. Anyone with the link will no longer be able to download, even if they could before.
- Will the viewer be notified that downloads are disabled?

  No notification is shown, but the download button or option is hidden/disabled in the document viewer.
- Can I still see analytics if downloads are turned off?

  Absolutely. Disabling downloads does not affect view tracking or analytics in any way.
- Can I combine this with other controls like password or OTP?

  Yes! In fact, we recommend using it alongside other access settings for more robust control.
- Can I disable downloads inside a data room too?

  Yes. This control can be applied to individual documents or across all files within a data room.
