## From the User‚Äôs Perspective

### How to disable downloads for a document

1. Go to your **Documents** tab
2. Find the document you want to manage
3. Click the **three dots (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢)** on the right-hand side
4. Open the **Access Controls** panel
5. Locate the setting called **‚ÄúAllow Download‚Äù**
6. Toggle it **off**

Once disabled, viewers will still be able to open and read the document‚Äîbut they **won‚Äôt be able to download it**.

### Why and When You Should Disable Downloads

**To Protect Confidential Content**

When you're sharing internal reports, financials, legal docs, or anything sensitive‚Äîdownload restrictions prevent unauthorized saving or accidental leaks.

**When:**

- Sharing board updates
- Sending investor decks
- Distributing HR/legal documents

**To Prevent Unapproved Redistribution**

If you‚Äôre sharing design work, proposals, or pitch decks, you may want people to see them‚Äîbut not store or reshare them outside of context.

**When:**

- Sharing visual mockups with clients
- Sending brand material under review
- Delivering watermarked documents

**To Maintain Control Over the Viewer Experience**

Sometimes, it‚Äôs important to control how and when someone sees your content. Disabling downloads keeps your content **view-only**, allowing you to track engagement without losing control of where your document ends up.

**When:**

- Delivering time-sensitive content
- Sharing docs that might be updated soon
- Presenting something without leaving a file trail

## From the Viewer‚Äôs Perspective

When a viewer opens your shared link:

- If downloads are **enabled**, they‚Äôll see a **download icon** or link
- If downloads are **disabled**, the option will be completely **hidden or inactive**
- They can still view the document in-browser as long as they meet the other access requirements (email, password, OTP, etc.)

This ensures your content stays **on-platform only**.

## Keep in Mind

- This is a **soft block**‚Äîviewers can‚Äôt click ‚ÄúDownload,‚Äù but **screenshots** or third-party tools are still possible.
- Combine this feature with **OTP verification** or **email restrictions** for maximum control.
- You can **toggle it on/off anytime**, even after the document has been shared.
