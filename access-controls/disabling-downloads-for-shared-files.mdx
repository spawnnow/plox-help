# Disabling downloads for shared files

## What is the ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô feature?

By using the ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô security feature for a document, the user can:

- Control whether viewers or visitors are allowed to download the document
- Prevent unauthorized offline sharing of sensitive files

<Info>
  When the ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô option is turned **off**, viewers can only view the document online and cannot save or distribute it outside the platform.
</Info>

When it is **enabled**, authorized users can securely download a copy. This ensures the document owner maintains full control over file distribution and data privacy.

## How to enable ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô

- Locate the file from ‚ÄòDocuments‚Äô or ‚ÄòDatarooms‚Äô section from the left side-bar
- After locating the file, it will have an information panel with its file name, status, security, etc
- On the right-side of this panel, there are 4 buttons. 1)**Share**, 2)**Analytics**, 3)**Security** and 4)**Delete** represented by an arrow, graph, lock and dustbin icon respectively.

- Toggle the ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô on. This displays the toggle filled with colour.

## How to disable ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô

- Follow the same steps as you would to enable downloads but instead of toggling the ‚ÄòAllow Download‚Äô feature, toggle it off.¬†
- After toggling the feature off, the purple coloured toggle will turn white signifying the feature is off
- This way, the viewers/visitors of the document will not be able to download the file.¬†

<Note>
  Note: Users that have already downloaded when the option was toggled on, will have it in their device storage
