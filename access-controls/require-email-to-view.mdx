## What is the â€˜Email Protectedâ€™ feature?

By using the â€˜Email Protectedâ€™ security feature for a document, the user can:

- Collect the email addresses of everyone who views the document
- Prevent anonymous or untracked access to sensitive files

This feature requires viewers to **enter their email ID before they can open the document**. Only after submitting a valid email address can they proceed to view it. If a viewer does not provide their email, access is denied.

<Info>
  All collected emails can be viewed by the document owner, allowing them to track who has viewed the document and maintain a clear record of engagement.

## How to enable â€˜Email Protectedâ€™

- Locate the file from â€˜Documentsâ€™ or â€˜Dataroomsâ€™ section from the left side-bar
- After locating the file, it will have an information panel with its file name, status, security, etc
- On the right-side of this panel, there are 4 buttons. 1)**Share**, 2)**Analytics**, 3)**Security** and 4)**Delete** represented by an arrow, graph, lock and dustbin icon respectively.

## How to disable â€˜Email Protectedâ€™

- After toggling the feature off, the purple coloured toggle will turn white signifying the feature is off

- This way, the viewers/visitors of the document will not be required to enter their email ID to view the document.

## FAQS

<Accordion title="How is this different from OTP verification?">
  OTP requires users to prove they own the email. This feature only asks for an email input, no confirmation step, so itâ€™s quicker and more frictionless.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find the collected email addresses?">
  Go to your documentâ€™s Analytics tab. Youâ€™ll see a list of all entered emails tied to each view session.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use these emails for email marketing later?">
  Yes. Many users collect emails through Plox to build lists for newsletters, updates, drip campaigns, or outreach.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I combine this with other access controls?">
  Yes! You can combine Require Email to View with expiration dates, download blocking, or even password protection, but not with OTP (as that becomes a different flow).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Whatâ€™s the best use case for this feature?">
  Itâ€™s perfect for collecting leads from shared pitch decks, reports, ebooks, or marketing materials, where you want to capture interest without losing the viewer to extra steps.
