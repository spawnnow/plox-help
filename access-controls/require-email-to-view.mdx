# Require email to view

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to enable it?

Here’s how to enable it:

1. Go to your **Documents** tab
2. Find the document you’ve uploaded
3. On the right-hand side of the document row, click the **three dots (•••)**
4. A side panel titled **Access Controls** will appear
5. In this panel, locate the **“Require Email to View”** option
6. Click the toggle to turn it **on**

Once enabled, anyone who opens your document link will be asked to enter their email before viewing it.

### What Happens to the Emails?

All submitted email addresses are:

- **Collected and stored securely**
- **Shown in your analytics dashboard**, linked to each view
- **Available for download/export** (if you're on the Pro plan)

### Use the collected emails to your advantage

You can use these emails for:

- **Follow-up outreach**
- **Lead nurturing**
- **Email marketing**
- **Investor or client re-engagement**
- **CRM enrichment**

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

### How to view it?

When someone clicks on your document link:

- A prompt appears asking them to **enter their email address**
- Once submitted, the document opens immediately—no OTP, no extra steps
- Viewers won’t be able to see the document unless they complete this step

This flow is smoother than full email+OTP verification, making it **less intrusive** and ideal for documents where you want **minimum friction** and **maximum reach**.

## Important to Know

While this feature helps capture viewer identities:

- **It does not verify ownership** of the email (i.e., no OTP or confirmation link)
- So it’s **possible** for someone to enter a fake or secondary email address
- That said, it’s still a **valuable low-friction option** when you don’t want to discourage views with too many steps

## FAQS

- How is this different from OTP verification?

  OTP requires users to prove they own the email. This feature only asks for an email input—no confirmation step, so it’s quicker and more frictionless.
- Where can I find the collected email addresses?

  Go to your document’s Analytics tab. You’ll see a list of all entered emails tied to each view session.
- Can I export the email addresses?

  Yes—if you’re on the Pro plan, you can export them as a CSV from the analytics section.
- Can I use these emails for email marketing later?

  Yes. Many users collect emails through Plox to build lists for newsletters, updates, drip campaigns, or outreach. Just make sure you're compliant with privacy laws in your region (like GDPR, CAN-SPAM, etc.).
- Can I combine this with other access controls?

  Yes! You can combine Require Email to View with expiration dates, download blocking, or even password protection—but not with OTP (as that becomes a different flow).
- What’s the best use case for this feature?

  It’s perfect for collecting leads from shared pitch decks, reports, ebooks, or marketing materials—where you want to capture interest without losing the viewer to extra steps.
