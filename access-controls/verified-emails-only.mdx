## What is the â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™ feature?

By using the â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™ security feature for a document, the user can:

- Ensure that only real and authenticated individuals can access the document
- Prevent fake or mistyped email addresses from gaining access

This feature works by asking the viewer to enter their email address before opening the document. An OTP (One-Time Password) is then sent to that email inbox. The viewer must verify the OTP to proceed, confirming that they are the rightful owner of the email ID.

## How to enable â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™

- Locate the file from â€˜Documentsâ€™ or â€˜Dataroomsâ€™ section from the left side-bar
- After locating the file, it will have an information panel with its file name, status, security, etc
- On the right-side of this panel, there are 4 buttons. 1)**Share**, 2)**Analytics**, 3)**Security** and 4)**Delete** represented by an arrow, graph, lock and dustbin icon respectively.

## How to disable â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™

- Follow the same steps as you would to enable â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™ but instead of toggling the â€˜Verified Emails Onlyâ€™ feature, toggle it off.Â 
- After toggling the feature off, the purple coloured toggle will turn white signifying the feature is off

(insert toggle movement off)

- This way, the viewers/visitors of the document will not be required to enter any OTP when accessing the document.Â
