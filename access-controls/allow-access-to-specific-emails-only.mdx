# Allow Access to Specific Emails Only

<Tip>
  The â€˜**Allow Specific Users**â€™ and â€˜**Email Protected**â€™ features cannot be used together at the same time
</Tip>

## What is the â€˜Allow Specific Usersâ€™ feature?

By using â€˜**Allow Specific Users**â€™ security feature for a document, the user can:

- Prevent unauthorized users from viewing the document
- Keep track of who has access to a document

This feature allows the user to have full control over which team members,employees and clients can view the document. Access can be revoked anytime if the document owner wants to remove the viewing access of a specific email ID.

## How to enable â€˜Allow Specific Usersâ€™

- Locate the file from â€˜**Documents**â€™ or â€˜**Datarooms**â€™ section from the left side-bar
- After locating the file, it will have an information panel with its file name, status, security, etc
- On the right-side of this panel, there are 4 buttons. 1)**Share**, 2)**Analytics**, 3)**Security** and 4)**Delete** represented by an arrow, graph, lock and dustbin icon respectively.

(Insert image of file panel)

- Click on the lock( ðŸ”’) icon \> Open â€˜**Configure Security Controls**â€™ side-bar on the right \> Find â€˜**Allow Specific Users**â€™ option.

(Insert security side-bar image)

- Toggle the â€˜**Allow Specific Users**â€™ on. This displays the toggle filled with colour and opens an email address box.Â

- Enter the email ID of the person you want to give access to view the document.
- If you want to add another email ID, click the â€˜**\+ Email**â€™ and type the email ID you want to add
- Repeat the same process to add more email IDs in the list

## How to remove users from the list

If in case, youâ€™d like to remove specific email IDs from the list of existing viewers who have been been given access to view the document, follow the steps below:

- Click the lock( ðŸ”’) icon \> open â€˜**Configure** **Security** **Controls**â€™ side-bar on the right \> find â€˜**Allow** **Specific** **Users**â€™ option.
- The â€˜**Allow** **Specific** **Users**â€™ option will be already toggled on and the list of emails will be displayed in this section.
- Next to each email ID, there will be a trash can icon(delete)

(insert image with arrow pointing to the delete icon)

- Click the trash can(delete) icon to remove the specific email ID from the viewing list.

This will immediately prevent that email ID from viewing the document. They will not receive any notification about this action done by the document owner.Â 

## Use cases
