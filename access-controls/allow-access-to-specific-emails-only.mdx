# Allow Access to Specific Emails Only

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to Enable and Set it up

1. Go to your **Documents** tab
2. Click the **three dots (•••)** next to the document you want to restrict
3. In the **Access Controls** panel, find **“Allow Specific Users”**
4. Toggle it **on**
5. Add the **email addresses** of the people who should have access
6. Save changes—done!

Now, only the users you’ve listed will be able to open the link.

### Why use this feature?

- Prevent unauthorized access—even if the link leaks
- Ensure only trusted teammates, clients, or reviewers can view your doc
- Avoid accidental sharing within larger organizations
- Useful when collaborating with small teams or company-only viewers

### Best Use Cases

- **Internal Team Sharing**

  Perfect for startups or agencies who want to securely share plans, designs, or decks within their team—just add internal emails.
- **Client-Specific Files**

  Share proposals, invoices, or reports with only your client’s email address, ensuring it doesn’t get passed around their org.
- **Private Feedback or Review**

  When sending drafts to reviewers, restrict it to only the people giving feedback—no unintentional viewers.
- **Board or Stakeholder Documents**

  Use this feature to share performance updates or confidential strategy docs with just your board members or select advisors.

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

When someone clicks the shared link:

- If their email is on the **allowed list**, they’ll be prompted to enter it and access the document normally
- If their email is **not** on the list, they will see an **access denied** message and won’t be able to proceed

This ensures your file stays _strictly private_, even if the link is forwarded.

## Notes on Usage

- This is an identity-based control, not verification—combine it with **Email Verification via OTP** for tighter security.
- Make sure the emails you enter are **accurate and accessible**, or users will be blocked.
- Viewers must enter the exact email you added to gain access.

## FAQs

- Can I add multiple emails at once?

  Yes. You can enter multiple email addresses, separated by commas or by pressing enter after each one.
- What happens if someone forwards the link?

  If their email is not on the allowed list, they won’t be able to view the document—even if they have the link.
- Can I edit or remove emails later?

  Absolutely. You can add, edit, or remove emails anytime in the Access Controls panel.
- Do viewers need to verify their email with an OTP?

  Not by default. If you want to verify the person entering the email, combine this feature with Email Verification via OTP.
- Will I see which of the allowed emails actually viewed the document?

  Yes. Plox’s analytics will show you who accessed the document from your approved list.
- Is this available in all plans?

  This feature is available in the Plus and Pro plans.
