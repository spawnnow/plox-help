# Allow Access to Specific Emails Only

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to Enable and Set it up

1. Go to your file’s dashboard.\
   Locate the file you want to protect. You’ll see a row of options such as Share, Analytics, Security, and Delete.
2. Open the Security settings.\
   Click the lock icon labeled “**Security**” next to the file name.
3. Enable “**Allow Specific Users**”\
   Turn on this option from the list of available security features.
4. Add the email addresses.\
   Enter the email IDs of the users who should have access to this file. You can add multiple emails.
5. Save your changes.\
   Click "Continue". The file is now locked to the listed email addresses only.

### How It Works

- Only the specified email addresses can open and view the file.
- Unauthorized users will see a “Restricted Access” message when trying to open the shared link.
- You can edit or remove allowed emails anytime from the same Security panel.
- Once this restriction is enabled, the Share option becomes available for the file.

### Why use this feature?

- Prevent unauthorized access, even if the link leaks
- Ensure only trusted teammates, clients, or reviewers can view your doc
- Avoid accidental sharing within larger organizations
- Useful when collaborating with small teams or company-only viewers

### Best Use Cases

- **Internal Team Sharing**

  Perfect for startups or agencies who want to securely share plans, designs, or decks within their team, just add internal emails.
- **Client-Specific Files**

  Share proposals, invoices, or reports with only your client’s email address, ensuring it doesn’t get passed around their org.
- **Private Feedback or Review**

  When sending drafts to reviewers, restrict it to only the people giving feedback, no unintentional viewers.
- **Board or Stakeholder Documents**

  Use this feature to share performance updates or confidential strategy docs with just your board members or select advisors.

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

When someone clicks the shared link:

- If their email is on the **allowed list**, they’ll be prompted to enter it and access the document normally
- If their email is **not** on the list, they will see an **access denied** message and won’t be able to proceed

This ensures your file stays _strictly private_, even if the link is forwarded.

## Notes on Usage

- This is an identity-based control, not verification, combine it with **Email Verification via OTP** for tighter security.
- Make sure the emails you enter are **accurate and accessible**, or users will be blocked.
- Viewers must enter the exact email you added to gain access.

## FAQs

- Can I add multiple emails at once?

  Yes. You can enter multiple email addresses, separated by commas or by pressing enter after each one.
- What happens if someone forwards the link?

  If their email is not on the allowed list, they won’t be able to view the document—even if they have the link.
- Can I edit or remove emails later?

  Absolutely. You can add, edit, or remove emails anytime in the Access Controls panel.
- Do viewers need to verify their email with an OTP?

  Not by default. If you want to verify the person entering the email, combine this feature with Email Verification via OTP.
- Will I see which of the allowed emails actually viewed the document?

  Yes. Plox’s analytics will show you who accessed the document from your approved list.
- Is this available in all plans?

  This feature is available in the Plus and Pro plans.
