# Email verification via OTP

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to enable it

1. Go to your **Documents** tab
2. Find the document you want to secure
3. Click the **three dots (•••)** on the right side of the document row
4. Open the **Access Controls** panel
5. Find **“Require Email Verification”**
6. Click the toggle to turn it **on**

Now, only users who **receive and verify** a code sent to their email will be able to access the document.

### Why Use OTP Verification?

- Ensures **100% verified identity** of the viewer
- Prevents link forwarding abuse—only real, verified recipients can access
- Ideal for **sensitive, high-value, or confidential documents**

### Best Use Cases

- **Investment Pitch Decks**

  When sharing sensitive financial or business information with VCs or angel investors, OTP ensures only the intended decision-maker can access your deck—no internal forwarding or leaks.
- **Fundraising Materials**

  Secure your startup’s term sheets, cap tables, and forecasts so they’re only accessible to verified investors. OTP adds trust and professionalism to your fundraising process.
- **Legal Documents**

  Contracts, NDAs, and compliance files often contain sensitive clauses. OTP helps ensure only the named party views the file—adding an extra layer of confidentiality.
- **M&A Files and Term Sheets**

  Share acquisition or partnership documents with peace of mind. OTP ensures secure access during high-stakes deals where every click matters.
- **Confidential Client Deliverables**

  Design files, financial audits, product roadmaps—share them securely with clients and know exactly who has opened them, and when.
- **Private Board or Internal Memos**

  Share strategy updates, quarterly results, or sensitive organizational info with executives or board members—knowing they’re the only ones who can view it.

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

When someone clicks the shared link:

1. They’ll be prompted to **enter their email address**
2. A **One-Time Password (OTP)** is instantly sent to that email
3. They must **enter the correct OTP** to proceed
4. Once verified, the document opens

If the OTP is incorrect or the viewer uses a fake email, they will **not** be granted access.

## Things to Note

- OTPs are **valid for a short time only** and must be used immediately
- Viewers must **have access to the inbox** of the email they enter
- Some users may **bounce off** if they don’t want to verify—so this method is best for serious or secure shares
- Requires the **Plus** or **Pro** plan
