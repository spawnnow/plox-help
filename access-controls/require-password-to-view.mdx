# Require password to view

## From the User’s Perspective

### How to enable it

1. Head to your **Documents** tab
2. Find the document you want to protect
3. Click the **three dots (•••)** on the far-right side of the document row
4. The **Access Controls** side panel will open
5. Find the **“Require Password to View”** option
6. Click the toggle to turn it **on**
7. You’ll be prompted to **enter and confirm a password** of your choice
8. Save changes

Now, anyone trying to view the document will need to enter that exact password before they can see its content.

### Why Use Password Protection?

- Add a **simple but effective layer of security**
- **Limit access** without verifying identity
- Great for **quick shares** with teams, clients, or partners when you don’t want to manage emails or access lists
- Works perfectly for **temporary sharing**, like time-limited links or documents shared during a call

### Best Use Cases

- Client contracts
- Internal reports
- Investor updates
- HR and legal docs
- Any file where you want to control access without collecting emails

### Important to Know

- Passwords are **not linked to viewer identity**
- You’ll **not see who opened the file**, unless you combine this with other features like **Require Email to View** or **OTP verification**
- Make sure to **share the password manually** (email, chat, calendar note, etc.)

## From the Viewer’s Perspective

When a recipient opens your link:

- A **password prompt** will appear
- They must enter the correct password to continue
- If the password is incorrect, access will be denied

## FAQs

- Can I choose any password I want?

  Yes! You can enter any password you'd like. Just make sure it's something your viewer can remember—or that you're ready to share securely.
- Can I update the password later?

  Yes. Just go back into Access Controls, turn the feature off and back on, and enter a new password.
- Can I use this with other access controls?

  Yes! You can combine password protection with expiration dates, download blocking, or even email collection for more security and insights.
- What happens if someone shares the link but not the password?

  The document won’t open. Password protection blocks all access unless the correct password is entered.
- Can I remove the password once it’s enabled?

  Absolutely. Just go to Access Controls and toggle the setting off. The document will become accessible according to the remaining access settings.
- Is this feature available on all plans?

  No. Require Password to View is available in Plus and Pro plans.
